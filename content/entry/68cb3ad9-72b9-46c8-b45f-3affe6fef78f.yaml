                  text: "A coffee plunger, a cafetière, a press pot or plunger pot and of course, simply French press has many names. But why so many of us like it?\_I guess it's\_be because it brings a cafe experience to home and makes delicious, rich, full-bodied brew. French press is so common that one would not call it a specialty coffee brewer, and yet you just might be wrong. The famous James Hoffman (whose youtube video tutorial\_is the most\_viewed one) validated it to be a specialty coffee brewer – hooray. ?"

                    So, a bit of history is necessary in any article, isn't so?
                    The fact that the first design on earth was done by the
                    Frenchmen in 1852, is correct, but it was without a seal
                    inside the carafe. There‘s a bit of debate as you can
                    imagine regarding who invented it. French or Italians?

                    *Interesting fact: Bodum company attempted to register
                    “French Press” as a trademark in several territories, but
                    was cut out in the U.S.

                    This timeless design of heat-resistant Pyrex glass beaker,
                    black durable bakelite plastic, chrome frame and handle made
                    its way to the big world. The popularity hasn‘t shrunk from
                    the first launch. Why? Because the simple and modest design
                    follows practicality: easy to dismantle, thus clean and
                    replace any parts. Genius idea, huh? And cool thing is that
                    those plunger pots have not deviated from the original
                    design so much. Of course companies evolve and manufacture
                    them in zillions of colors and materials, the simplicity and
                    design remains almost the same, well-known and dear. Brands
                    like Hario, Bialetti, Barista & Co and OXO all offer their
                    own version of design and style.

                    Quite hard to press the filter down? Your grind is too fine;
                    conversely if there is minimal resistance then the grind is
                    too coarse. Play with all the variables if the taste doesn't
                    please you. Making coffee should be enjoyable and
                    experimental!

                    Cleaning is really TOP priority for flavorful coffee, so
                    clean often and really thoroughly, as old coffee grounds
                    have the tendency to stuck in the filters, will have no
                    mercy on your fresh coffee. Most filters can be disassembled
                    for cleaning

                    *Interesting fact no. 2: George Howell, an American
                    specialty coffee pioneer in early 1970s, who started Coffee
                    Connection who was later acquired by the Starbucks
                    Corporation – he and the team used only French press to
                    serve their origins coffee (and they would sometimes have 12
                    origins on the menu). Imagine that, all brewed with a French
                    press at that time. But hey, it does have a great potential
                    to brew delicious cup.
