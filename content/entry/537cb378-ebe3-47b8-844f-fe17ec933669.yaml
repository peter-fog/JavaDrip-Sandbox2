The body is stainless steel, the group head is surprisingly a commercial standard 58mm with a pretty decent portafilter to go with it. It is a single boiler machine, however these are the limits to expect at such a price point. The steam pressure can produce very silky and consistent milk. The overall feel of the machine is a bit plastic, with buttons and levers just feeling slightly cheap.\_"

                    Minimal in design and quite utilitarian, the Gaggia Classic
                    makes up for what it lacks in looks with its gorgeous
                    espresso it produces. With fully commercial grade parts,
                    like 58mm group heads and quality made boilers, this little
                    machine will last a lifetime if kept well.

                    The internals of the machine are easily accessible with
                    parts readily available to order if you wanted to fix,
                    upgrade and mod yourself. There are communities online who
                    have done it all to their machines which you can follow
                    along and play around at home yourself.

                    Stainless steel body, 58mm Portafilter, PID, Heat exchange
                    and pump pressures that rival commercial machines there
                    isn't much to go wrong with the Bianca from Lelit. The true
                    question left to ask at well over $4000 is, is it worth it?
                    Being such a niche company, parts and repairs are extremely
                    expensive and can take weeks to even get the ball rolling.

                    Starting at $8000 for a base unit, it is very quick to
                    realise you are paying for a brand name over anything else.
