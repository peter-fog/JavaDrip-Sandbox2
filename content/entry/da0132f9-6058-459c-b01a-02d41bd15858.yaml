        We purchased the JavaDrip Speciality coffee maker with the fold-away
        frother I'm a fan of making my own coffee at home (have used Bunn &
        multiple Keuirg models). After going back & forth on if I wanted to get
        it, I figured I definitely should give it a try. And I'm so glad I did!


        I love the selection of brew styles & sizes, the short time it takes to
        brew all sizes from normal cup to full pot/carafe! And the fold-away
        frother is a nice touch along with the included smart cup that has
        serving suggestions for each size on how many scoops to add. Which is
        nice for our daughter that is in high-school, she can easily make her
        coffee in the mornings to take to school with her without worrying if
        she's using too much or little. I would recommend it!
