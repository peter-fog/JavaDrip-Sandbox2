                    If you’re already a fan of the stuff, you likely don’t need
                    convincing that coffee is a good thing. Not only does it
                    wake up your senses and brain to prepare for the day, but
                    it’s also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease,
                    certain cancers and mental deterioration. But really, those
                    who sip coffee do so chiefly because it tastes good — and
                    what if you could make that morning cup even better? Here
                    are seven ways to improve your brew.

                    Moisture is the enemy of a decent brew. When you dig into a
                    bag of beans from the freezer every morning, you expose it
                    to humidity — not to mention odors from the other foods
                    around it. Plus, the beans can get freezer burn. Instead,
                    keep beans in an airtight container in a cool, dark place
                    like the pantry.

                    When properly stored (remember, in the pantry!), coffee
                    beans won’t ever really go bad. But as beans age, they will
                    lose their flavor. Purchasing smaller quantities ensures
                    that you always have fresh, tasty coffee available. Plus, it
                    allows you to try new roasts and blends more often.

                    You know why they stack the coffee cups on top of the
                    cappuccino machine at your favorite Italian restaurant? To
                    keep them warm, which helps your coffee stay hot longer. To
                    keep your mug toasty at home, fill it with hot water while
                    you wait for the coffee to brew. If you take cream or milk,
                    heat it in a mug in the microwave before you add your java.

                    Don’t limit yourself to the varieties at the grocery store.
                    Try adding a spent vanilla bean (meaning you’ve already
                    scraped out the seeds), ground cinnamon (or other baking
                    spices), fresh herbs, dried fruits or citrus zest to the
                    filter before brewing. Or toss a cup of ground beans with
                    some of your favorite flavor extract.

Pour the warmed milk into 1/2 cup very strong coffee (or 1/3 cup espresso) and top it off with the reserved foam.\_"
