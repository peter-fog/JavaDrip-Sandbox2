                    Coffee shouldn't be difficult. It is a journey yes, and
                    everyone is on that journey. However, the entry should never
                    be overwhelming and protected by bearded barista knights.
                    Coffee is best drunk however YOU drink it, and I hope this
                    has helped you to find the ways you can order, buy and make
                    coffee yourself without getting lost in the jargon.

        The last two decades has seen a surge in coffee shops, most noticeably
        across city suburbs.  We have made ordering a cup of coffee as
        complicated and bespoke as an architecturally designed house.
