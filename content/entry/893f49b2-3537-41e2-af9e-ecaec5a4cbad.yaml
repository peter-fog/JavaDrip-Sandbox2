Meaning, just because they are ready to be broken down it doesn't mean that they\_ARE\_breaking down. Yes, your body is in a constant state of burning fats for energy and a higher metabolism means a high rate of fats being burnt for energy, these figures are so minuscule that you will\_NEVER\_see a physical result to your waistline through this alone.\_There are studies showing that caffeine increases your resting metabolic rate by\_3–11%, with larger doses having a greater effect! In the short term, this is great! After a while people build up a tolerance to the effects and it stops working. One study showed that caffeine increased fat burning by as much as\_29%\_in lean people, while the increase was only about\_10%\_in obese people. The effect also appears to decrease with age and is greater in younger individuals. You could argue that by drinking\_ROBUSTA\_coffee you are doubling your caffeine intake, therefore doubling your RMR (resting metabolic rate). Is this worth it? I would tend to stick with a high quality arabica for the taste, than to grimace through robusta coffee for a slight increase in my resting metabolic rate.\_"

However, another study showed\_no\_effect for men. So really it is just a personal thing.\_In a basic sense, it makes sense that having\_SOMETHING\_in your belly is better than having nothing. And downing a cup of coffee is a great way to fill that void whilst also counting those calories.\_"

        What if I told you there could be a way to shave off those kilos without
        having to lift a single weight? You would call me crazy, right? The
        answer might not be a far fetched as you think, coming from the most
        unlikely source.
