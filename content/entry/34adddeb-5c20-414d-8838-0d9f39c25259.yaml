                    Acidity is a central component of how coffee tastes. When
                    coffee professionals discuss “acidity,” they are referring
                    to the existence of certain acids that affect the taste of
                    coffee. Acidity does not refer to the actual acid content;
                    rather, it refers to a flavor note.Coffee with a high
                    acidity level is commonly referred to as “bright.” But
                    overall, the word “acid” can be a little perplexing, but
                    when it comes to food, acidic isn’t really a bad thing.

                    Coffee contains a wide range of acids. We will focus on the
                    acids that survive the roasting process in this review
                    because these are the acids that affect the final flavor of
                    a coffee. The first ones on the list have a positive impact
                    on coffee, while those further down the list can have both
                    positive and negative effects.

                    Citric acid is found in arabica beans grown at higher
                    elevations. This acid, commonly found in citrus fruits, is
                    associated with lemon, lime, and grapefruit notes when mixed
                    with phosphoric acid.

                    Phosphoric acid tastes sweeter than most acids. It has the
                    ability to turn a sour citrus taste into a sweeter
                    grapefruit or mango flavor.

                    Although it is more common to taste apple or pear in a malic
                    acid-containing coffee, it is often associated with hints of
                    stone fruit, such as peaches or plums.

                    Chlorogenic acids (CGAs) are the primary cause of coffee’s
                    perceived acidity. When compared to other acids, they
                    disappear quickly during roasting and break down into Quinic
                    and other acids. In a medium roast coffee, 50% of the CGAs
                    have been destroyed which is why light roasts are often
                    defined as “bright” and “acidic” rather than dark roasts.

                    Acetic acid, the same acid contained in vinegar, can provide
                    a pleasant sharpness at lower concentrations. Higher acetic
                    acid concentrations, on the other hand, are nasty. A coffee
                    with a high acetic acid content was most likely improperly
                    processed.

                    Tartaric acid, like acetic acid, has a bitter taste in high
                    concentrations. It can, however, provide grape-like or
                    wine-like notes at low concentrations, which is not
                    surprising considering that it is found in grapes.

                    Quinic acid is formed as a byproduct of the breakdown of
                    other acids. It is abundant in darkly roasted coffee, stale
                    coffee, and coffee that was brewed several hours ago but
                    kept warm on a hot plate. Although it gives coffee a clean
                    finish, quinic acid is the main acid that causes the sour
                    feeling on your stomach.

                    The concentrations of specific acids change as green beans
                    undergo chemical reactions during the roasting process. Most
                    acids decay at higher temperatures, but some actually
                    increase in temperature. In general, the roasting method
                    attempts to bring out the best combination of naturally
                    occurring acids present in a particular coffee, since these
                    are the compounds that give the coffee its distinct
                    characteristics.Simply put, coffee, in its purest form,
                    contains a wide range of acids, both good and bad. Some
                    disappear during the roasting process, while others remain,
                    so roasting is all about finding the right combination of
                    acidity, aroma, and body.

        Coffee is marketed as an acidic beverage, but it actually has a pH of
        about five, making it less acidic than beer, orange juice, and even
        soda. When we talk about acid and coffee, we aren’t really referring to
        the pH level of the beverage.
