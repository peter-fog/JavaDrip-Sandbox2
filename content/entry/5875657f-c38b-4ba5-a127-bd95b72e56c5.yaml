                    Water is essential for all life on earth, however we rely on
                    a balance of water to sustain life. Too little and we dry
                    up, too much and we flood.

                    Like all fine things in life, complex flavors rely on
                    balance to really bring to life all the amazing tastes and
                    sensations. The same applies to coffee, with its inability
                    to cope with unbalanced or over balanced dosing.

                    I tend to refer to coffee as being allergic to the 21st
                    century, and if you thought hipsters were fussy about their
                    coffee, you’ll be surprised to know that their coffee is WAY
                    more fussy than they are!

                    Lets focus on RATIOs. Specifically the WATER:COFFEE ratio in
                    both your BASKET and your CUP!

                    Let’s assume you have a 16g basket (most breville, delonghi
                    and sunbeam baskets are 16g-18g). If you are unsure, go have
                    a quick read of your manual and come back.

                    Now if you have a 16g basket you are wanting to add 16g of
                    ground coffee into your basket, and hoping for 32ml of
                    espresso pouring out the other end.

                    This is a guide, not a rule, the bigger that basket means
                    more grinds and more espresso. We have a 22g basket in the
                    Cafe, and we run 22.5g In, hoping for a 50ml extraction.
                    Adjust the guide to your machine and preference, whilst
                    keeping as much to this ratio as possible

                    All of this, however, should be done within an extraction
                    time of about 30-35 Seconds. Almost every espresso coffee is
                    made in the golden 30 Second timer, and is just the best
                    output when placed against HEAT and PRESSURE. Science tells
                    us that coffee cannot taste good if the time it extracts in
                    is any more or any less than 30 seconds, however that is a
                    can of worms we can open another day!

                    Now that you have your perfect golden ratio espresso, and
                    you are pouring that beautifully made espresso into your
                    cup. The best way to get the best flavors is finding an 8oz
                    cup, for your 1oz of espresso. Adding 7oz of water, milk,
                    whatever, into your 1oz of espresso creates the perfect
                    balance of coffee to additive ratio.

                    Obviously if you are playing along at home, you won’t be
                    scientifically measuring how many ounces your coffee cups
                    are, I recommend finding your favorite and adjusting to
                    taste from there. (Everyone should have a favorite coffee
                    cup, it’s part of adulthood). A standard cup being 250ml
                    will do, however 7oz is around the 200ml mark, again the
                    ratio is a GUIDE rather than a RULE!

                    And that’s that, a perfectly ratioed cup of coffee in its
                    purest form. Now keep in mind a larger cup will require more
                    coffee, however as long as you are following the GOLDEN
                    RATIO you are good as gold!
