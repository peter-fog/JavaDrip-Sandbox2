Better yet, you can actually light the grinds on fire, and have them smoulder like incense. This will keep away mozzies, midges and all other annoying critters. Sadly the incense burning works better on unused grinds (so best burn the old grinds that you won't be using anymore) however a bit of lighter fluid will help the spent grinds along easier.\_"

This is done before you add in any shampoo, and what it does is catch and remove any oils and grit in your hair and prepare it for the shampoo. The beauty of using spent grinds is that the oils from the coffee are all gone, so it will actually soak up any oils from your hair and scrub it ready for cleaning.\_Blondes do have to be careful, as the coffee will naturally darken lighter hair, adding a coffee colored sheen to your head of hair.\_"

Luckily we give most of our spent coffee back into the community via local farms and hobby gardeners. If we were to donate those 180 kg of coffee to BIO BEAN, using their processes we could power one london bus for an ENTIRE DAY That’s just using waste from one small local cafe in Brisbane over a two week period.\_"
